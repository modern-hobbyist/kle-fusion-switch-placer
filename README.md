# KLE Switch Placer

A Fusion 360 Add-In that takes a [Keyboard Layout Editor (KLE)](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) JSON file and replicates a chosen 3D model (e.g., a switch or keycap) along the layout.

Ideal for keyboard designers looking to quickly populate a layout with 3D models directly in Fusion 360, this tool provides a simple UI to select a layout file, choose a model, and define custom spacing.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ File picker to import your KLE JSON layout  
- ‚úÖ Select any existing component in your Fusion model to replicate  
- ‚úÖ Set **custom horizontal and vertical spacing** in millimeters  
- ‚úÖ Automatically places switches based on the layout's `x`, `y`, and `w`, `h` values

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- üîÑ **Rotated keys** (`r` and `rx`/`ry` in KLE) are not fully supported yet. They are placed roughly where expected, but their rotation origin may be off, especially for non-zero rotations. I'm still working on perfecting this logic.

## üôè Credit & Inspiration

This Add-In was inspired by [misterkeebs/fusion360_scripts](https://github.com/misterkeebs/fusion360_scripts), which helped demonstrate how to work with KLE JSON layouts in Fusion. I built this version to add Fusion-native file selection and spacing configuration.
